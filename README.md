mathjax-tests
=============

Tests and sample files for trying stuff out with MathJax.

These all use a relative path to the MathJax library itself, so that should be cloned
as a sibling of this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Klortho/mathjax-tests.git
git clone https://github.com/Klortho/MathJax.git
```
